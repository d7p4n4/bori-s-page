# bori-s-page
It's a responsive webpage, that contains of an artist's works. The page starts with a full-screen header, that contains the main infos about the artist, and 4 buttons, so we can say, that header is the menu too. If we click on one button, another page will appears, and the header slide up. 

First contains a lot of poems, that are displayed by five in one table, and then you can turn the page (appears another five of poems), with the navbar. The bottom stays the same, it shows the first book of poems of the artist, a short description, and some links, which refer to the book or it's content. 

Second, is about the pics. It is another table, that you can turn the page of it. If you click on a pic, this will fill almost the whole screen.

Third, contains videos and a description about the slam. The "info" buttons are working, and you will see the youtube link, and few words about the video, when you click on it.

Fourth, is about the artist.

On the bottom of each page there is a footer with copyright.
The webpage is fully responsive, with two breakpoints. (720px, 1024px) It seems okay in phones, tablets, and laptops too.
